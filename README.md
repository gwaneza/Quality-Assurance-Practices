# Documentation and Presentation

# Presentation Outline
# Overview of Test Automation Framework and Tools Used

- Framework: Playwright
- Tools: GitHub Actions for CI/CD, HTML reports for results visualization
- Note: Playwright was chosen for its comprehensive browser automation capabilities, its compatibility in automating applications developed in the Node.js framework, and its easy integration with CI/CD pipelines.

# Explanation of Test Scenarios and Test Cases

- Test Scenarios: Add items to-do lists, mark some items as completed, delete completed items, and add validations.

# Demonstration of Test Execution Process
# A. Setup & Configuration Process for the Automated Test Suite

- Create a Git Repository named "Quality-Assurance-Practices"
- Go to "Code" to clone the Git repository
- Click on the "copy icon"
- Setup and Download the VSCode editor: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- Open the VSCode terminal
- Initialize npm and install Playwright:

~ npm init -y
~ npm install playwright

- Create an e2e.spec file to hold all the tests
- Start writing automated tests
- Save and run tests using the following commands:
- To run tests in the terminal:

~ npm playwright test

- To run tests in the UI:

~ npm playwright test --ui

- To run and generate a dashboard of test results and reports:

~ npm playwright show-report

# B. Cloud Automation

- If all tests are passing, push changes to GitHub by running these commands:

~ git add .
~ git commit -m "running the tests in github"

- Push to the repository "Quality-Assurance-Practices":

~ git push origin main

- Go to the GitHub repo and verify if the tests are passing.
- Click on Action and verify if the test is passing.

# C. Summary of Test Results

- Test Results: All test cases passed and the HTML result was generated.

# Challenges Faced During the Test Automation Process and Solutions: 

- Challenge: HomeBrew could not be installed.
- Solution: Run git commands from the brew repository.
- Challenge: Accessing my GitHub account with 2FA.
- Solution: Unlink my existing account and create a new one.

# D. Summary of the Assessment Undertaken

Setting up the test automation suite involved installing and configuring Playwright, automating test scenarios, and ensuring tests run independently and successfully locally, on the browser level, and through GitHub Actions. The presentation includes an overview of the tools, detailed test scenarios, a demonstration of test execution, a summary of results, and the challenges faced while completing the task.
